config BSP_ARCH_KERNEL_ATAGS_ADDRESS
	hex "Kernel ATAGS parameter address"
	default 0x80000100 
	help
	    This is the address where the ATAGS parameters for the ARM  kernel 
	    will reside. It's used by the bootloader and the kernel. Don't change
	    unless you know what are you doing.

config BSP_ARCH_KERNEL_LOAD_ADDRESS
	hex "Kernel physical start address (multiple of 4096 bytes)"
	default 0x80008000 
	help
	    This is the default kernel load address. However this value can be
	    change at runtime since the kernel entry is position independent

config BSP_ARCH_KERNEL_ENTRY_ADDRESS
	hex "Kernel entry physical address"
	default 0x80008000 
	help
	    This is the default kernel load address. However this value can be
	    change at runtime since the kernel entry is position independent

config BSP_ARCH_KERNEL_COMPRESS

	Compress the kernel image in flash and decompress it when booting.

config BSP_ARCH_KERNEL_ZTEXTADDR
	depends on BSP_ARCH_KERNEL_COMPRESS
	hex "Decompressor start address"
	default "0x81E00000"
	help
	Start address of decompressor from the SDRAM base.
       	
	You normally call the kernel at this address to start it booting.
	
	This address will hold the decompressor logic that will extract the
	compressed kernel. For this decompression a work area is going to be used
	and the extracted kernel is going to be let at the SDRAM base address.

        hex "Decompressor working area start address"

        help
	Start address of zero-initialised work area for the decompressor.

	This work area is going to be used just for the decompression steps,
	then it will be free.
